Things to show off:
 - General functionality
  - Wiring, example of api (products api), session management, db switch
 - Swaggo UI
  - Match to js version
  - Explain small differences in look but for this, the same functionality
  - Browser manages the session cookie, so once logged in app sets it and browser sorts it
   - Therefore can log in and then perform other requests that require authentication
  - Show the comments that make it work and explain how that is
  - Two downsides:
   - Requirement for these api function comments adds bloat to files
   - Doesnt seem to auto-magically import with the rest of the application so students need to run two `go get` commands to allow functionality
 - GORM database
  - Very powerful and useful
  - Really easy to use once used to it
  - Show my handler implementation, database objects and comments they require for correct naming
  - Conversion from other objects to db objects required to use model based queries rather than forming SQL manually
 - Hook up to frontend package
  - Explain that its the one my team had so doesnt fully work
  - Shows that the go backend can work with the frontend js implementation
  - Show the comments on objects to be returned by the api so it works with frontend
 - Any questions?
